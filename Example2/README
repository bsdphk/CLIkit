This is a slighly more involved, but less portable example:

In Main/ we build the central bit of a program which can load
modules which extends its functionality

In Dummy/ is one such incredibly unfunctinal module.

I have used the FreeBSD Makefile-infrastructure here for expediency.
For reasons totally beyond reason, there is no standardized portable
way to build a loadable object.

On FreeBSD, do this:

	make depend
	make
	( cd Main ; ./MTPns )
