Welcome to CLIkit

This is the third generation of a facility I have used for many years,
which makes it easy to add a CLI interface to a C program.

CLI commands are described in a structured format:

	LEAF foo INT {
		# Comment2
		desc    "state of foobar"
		func    do_foo                  # Comment3
		name    match_foo
	}

	LEAF bar REAL {
		desc    "percentage of snafu"
		func    do_bar
	}

	INSTANCE things UINT {
		desc    "things of sorts"
		func    things_instance

		LEAF this UINT {
			desc "what is this"
			func do_things_this
		}
		LEAF that WORD INT {
			desc "point to that"
			func do_things_that
		}

		INSTANCE junk WORD {
			desc "junk"
			func junk_instance

			LEAF whatchamacallit REAL {
				desc "thingmajics"
				func pitch_it
			}
		}
	}

And the python script converts this into datastructures and code, which
handles all the tedious stuff like a "help" facility:

	critter phk> ./a.out foo
	help
	  snafu:
	    foo <INT>                  state of foobar
	  foo <INT>                    state of foobar
	  bar <REAL>                   percentage of snafu
	  things <UINT>:               things of sorts
	    this <UINT>                what is this
	    that <WORD> <INT>          point to that
	    junk <WORD>:               junk
	      whatchamacallit <REAL>   thingmajics

This newest iteration is a complete rewrite, for increased portability
and agility, but it is not complete yet, so caveat emptor.

One of the central ideas in this rewrite, is that everything is
contained in a single python script, so that should be all you need
to pull into your own software project.
